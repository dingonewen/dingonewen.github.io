  <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
  I am a <strong>high-signal communicator</strong>. In a world of noise, I value brevity, precision, and the strategic use of humor to bridge gaps between cross-functional teams. I like to call myself a <strong>Humor Retriever</strong> — loyal to the joke, always chasing the laugh, and firmly believing that if you can’t explain a complex system with a smile, you don't understand it well enough.
</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
  My academic journey began with a fascination for <strong>Physics</strong>, which evolved into a <strong>BEng and BS in Food Science & Engineering</strong>. Far from just "cooking," this path allowed me to apply rigorous engineering principles — thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and process control — to volatile biological systems at <strong>CAU and Cornell</strong>. It taught me how to manage the unpredictable, a skill that translates surprisingly well to debugging distributed systems.
</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
  After three years in the biotech industry navigating the complexities of lab ops and project management, I recognized that software is the ultimate lever for engineering impact. Now, at <strong>Penn MCIT</strong>, I am merging my industry-hardened project management experience with deep technical training. I view this "second chance" at education not just as a pivot, but as a systematic upgrade of my toolkit.
</p>
  <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
  Currently, I am seeking a <mark>2026 Summer TPM or SDE Internship</mark> where I can apply my unique blend of engineering rigor and full-stack development. I prepare for the worst, architect for the best, and debug everything in between. If you’d like to discuss systems, agentic workflows, or tell a joke that’s actually funnier than mine, feel free to reach out. I monitor my inbox with the latency of a high-frequency trading system.

      <img src="/images/soccerfood.jpg" alt="Soccer and Food" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 15px 15px; border-radius: 8px;">
      
      <p style="text-indent: 2em;">I tend to live a fairly structured and disciplined life, but outside of work and study, I have a few simple joys — <em>free food</em>, <em>quality sleep</em>, and watching <em>soccer</em> games.</p>
      
      <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Before I immersed myself in science, I spent my early years as a semi-professional <strong>Go player</strong>. By age 10, I had reached a ranking among the top 30 in my province — a milestone that required countless hours of strategic thinking and discipline. Then came AlphaGo. Its emergence didn't discourage me; instead, it sparked a profound fascination with artificial intelligence and what it could achieve. That moment planted a seed — a desire to understand, embrace, and even challenge the AI revolution. In many ways, my journey from the Go board to computer science is less about changing paths and more about continuing the same match, just with different opponents.</p>
      
      <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Besides enhancing my technical background, I am also preparing to volunteer at the FIFA 2026 World Cup in Philly. I steer clear of high-impact workouts — mostly because I'd like to keep all my joints intact — so swimming has become my sport of choice. When life slows down, I swim about 25 km a month. My favorite athletes <a href="https://www.f-zd.com/">Fan Zhendong</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/fighter/_/id/4350762/zhang-weili">Zhang Weili</a>, and <a href="https://kylianmbappe.com/en/">Kylian Mbappé</a> — have always inspired me. Their character, resilience, and dedication to their goals continue to motivate me in my own pursuits.</p>
      
      <p style="text-indent: 2em;">I am an early-to-bed, early-to-rise kind of person — late nights and I simply don't get along. I enjoy calm, mellow <em>music</em>, and my favorite artist and producer is <a href="https://khalilfong.com/2017/" target="_blank">Khalil Fong</a>. I’ve always admired his calm and kind nature, as well as his dedication and professionalism, which I consistently strive to learn from.</p>
      
      <p style="text-indent: 2em;"> I am also a <strong>certified BLS provider</strong>. Amid a busy life, earning my Basic Life Support certification reminded me of the true power of contribution—to step beyond grades, projects, and deadlines, and to be prepared to make a real difference when every second counts.
      
      <p style="text-indent: 2em;"> <em>Cooking</em> is how I connect with myself — it’s quiet, grounding, and creative. I haven’t had sugar or dairy in years and never drink, so making simple, healthy meals brings me a sense of balance and home. Of course, free food is the exception, and I secretly adore basque cheesecake and triple chocolate cookies.
