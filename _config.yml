  I’m not much of a talker in person, but I enjoy showing off my humor in chats. I like to call myself a **Humor Retriever** — loyal to the joke, always chasing the laugh. The only thing that truly unsettles me is meeting someone funnier than I am.

  Before college, my favorite subject was Physics. I did fairly well in it, but I decided to major in something that felt more... digestible — <mark>Food Science</mark>. Since I’ve always dreamed of running a restaurant, it turned out to be a surprisingly good fit, and I gained a solid foundation in scientific thinking.

  After three years in biotech — and more ups and downs than I can count — I decided to pivot to <mark>Computer Science</mark> at Penn following a two-year deferral. It’s not every day you get a second chance at education after joining the workforce, and I’m genuinely grateful for it.

  Despite the challenging job market, I remain optimistic. I prepare for the worst, hope for the best, and debug everything in between — that’s my philosophy for both code and life.

  I’m currently honing my programming skills and seeking a 2026 summer internship as a <mark>Technical Project Manager</mark> or <mark>Software Developer</mark>. If you’d like to get to know me better — or, as some call it, “an interview” — feel free to reach out by email. I check my inbox approximately three times per second.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
