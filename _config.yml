about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I don't talk much in my private life, but I love showing off my humor in group chats. I call myself <mark> humor retriever </mark>, and the only thing makes me nervous is when someone I know is funnier than me. 

  Before college my favorite subject is Physics, and I did quite well in this, but I don't think I am smart enough to major in it so I chose one I thought may had been relavant - <mark> Food Science </mark>. Considering my dream is to own a restaurant this major may be a good fit, and I did learn a lot of fundamental science from this solid training.  
  You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started#what-is-markdown) supports such as
    - Lists
    - Tables
    - <a href="google.com">Links</a>

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
